# Show Explorer (React + Vite)

A small React app for browsing **TV shows** using the public **TVMaze API** (no API key required).  
Features include a “Now Airing (US)” view, search with client-side paging, and a show detail page with cast.

## Tech
- React + Vite
- React Router
- Simple state management with `useState` / `useEffect`
- Async data fetching with `fetch`
- Lightweight styling with inline styles + skeletons + error banners
